However, the table does not provide any information about when other countries joined the European Union or whether the Czech Republic was among the first to join.\n\n2. **Statement Analysis**: The statement claims that the Czech Republic was \"one of the first countries\" to join the European Union. To verify this, we would need information about the order in which countries joined the EU and whether the Czech Republic's joining date (1 May 2004) was among the earliest.\n\n3. **Information Availability**: The table does not contain any data about other countries' joining dates or the historical context of the EU's expansion.

The Commonwealth was established under the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which was a transitional arrangement leading to full independence in 1946.

In the table, the \"Labels\" column lists \"The Glorious Dead RecordsWarner\" as the label.\n\n2. **Interpret the label information**: The label mentioned is \"The Glorious Dead RecordsWarner.\" This appears to be a combination of \"The Glorious Dead Records\" and \"Warner.\" Warner is likely a reference to Warner Music Group, which is a major (big) record label. \n\n3. **Determine if the label is \"big\"**: Warner Music Group is indeed one of the \"big three\" record labels globally, which would qualify it as a big label. However, the table does not explicitly state that Warner is the parent company or that Flatbush Zombies are directly signed to Warner (it could be a subsidiary or a partnership). \n\n4. **Assess the certainty**: While the presence of \"Warner\" in the label name strongly suggests an association with a big label, the table does not provide explicit confirmation that Flatbush Zombies are \"signed by\" Warner (as opposed to a subsidiary or independent partnership). \n\nGiven this ambiguity, the most accurate answer is that there is **not enough information** to definitively confirm or refute the statement. The table hints at a possible association with a big label, but it is not explicit enough to entail the statement. \n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{not enough info}"

This confirms that Gaborone is indeed the capital of Botswana.\n\n2. **Official Languages**: The table lists the official languages as \"English, Setswana\". This means that both English and Setswana are recognized as official languages in Botswana.\n\n3. **Statement Analysis**: The claim is that \"English is the only language in Gaborone\". However, the table shows that Setswana is also an official language. While the table does not provide specific information about language usage in Gaborone (as opposed to the country as a whole), the fact that Setswana is an official language of Botswana strongly suggests that it is likely used in the capital as well. \n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the table explicitly lists two official languages for Botswana, the statement that \"English is the only language in Gaborone\" is **refuted** by the table. The presence of Setswana as an official language contradicts the claim that English is the only language.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{refuted}"

The table does not mention any theories he created or their validity.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The table confirms that Kalman Tihanyi was a physicist (among other professions), but it does not provide evidence to support the subjective claim of being \"really great.\"\n- The table does not mention any theories he created, only inventions. Therefore, there is no information about the validity of his theories.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{not enough info}"

The timeline aligns (886 AD is after 476 AD), and the subject (the city) is the same.\n\nThus, the statement is **entailed** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{entailed}"

To verify this, we would need information about Botswana's geographic coordinates, specifically its latitude.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Table for Relevant Information\nThe table provides the following geographic information:\n- Under \"Capital and largest city,\" the coordinates for Gaborone are given as \"-24.6583; 25.9083\". \n\nHere, \"-24.6583\" is the latitude, and \"25.9083\" is the longitude. \n\n### Step 3: Interpret the Latitude\n- A negative latitude indicates a location south of the equator. \n- Gaborone's latitude is -24.6583, which means it is approximately 24.6583 degrees south of the equator.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince the capital city (and likely the country) is south of the equator, the statement \"The Republic of Botswana is located north of the equator\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{refuted}"

        "predict": "To determine whether the statement \"Joy was released in December to be eligible for Oscar contention in 2015\" is entailed, refuted, or if there is not enough information based on the given table, let's analyze the relevant information step by step:\n\n1. **Release Date**: The table states that \"Joy\" was released on:\n   - December 13, 2015 (New York City)\n   - December 25, 2015 (United States)\n   This confirms that the movie was indeed released in December 2015.\n\n2. **Oscar Eligibility**: The statement mentions that the release was \"to be eligible for Oscar contention in 2015.\" The table does not provide any explicit information about the intent behind the release date (i.e., whether it was specifically for Oscar eligibility). However, it is a well-known industry practice that movies released in December are often timed to be fresh in the minds of Oscar voters during the nomination period (which typically begins in early January of the following year). \n\n3. **Conclusion**: While the table confirms the December 2015 release date, it does not explicitly state the reason for the release timing (Oscar eligibility). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the release was specifically for Oscar contention based solely on the table. \n\nHowever, given the common industry practice and the fact that the release date aligns with Oscar eligibility windows, the statement is *likely* true, but the table does not provide direct evidence for the intent. \n\nThus, the correct answer is: **not enough info**, because the table does not explicitly mention the reason for the December release. \n\n\\boxed{not enough info}"

This is the most relevant part for verifying the given statement.\n\n2. **Check the \"Associated acts\" list**: The associated acts listed are:\n   - Space Ritual\n   - Inner City Unit\n   - Motarhead (Note: This is likely a typo or alternative spelling for \"Mot\u00f6rhead\")\n   - Pink Fairies\n\n   The statement mentions \"Motley Crue,\" which is not listed in the associated acts.\n\n3. **Compare with the statement**: The statement claims that Hawkwind is known for performing with Motley Crue. However, Motley Crue is not mentioned anywhere in the table, and the table does not provide any information about collaborations or performances with Motley Crue.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the table does not mention Motley Crue at all, and there is no information to support the claim, we cannot confirm the statement. However, the table does list other associated acts, which suggests that if Motley Crue were associated with Hawkwind, it might have been included. This absence could imply that the statement is false, but strictly speaking, the table does not provide explicit evidence to refute it either. \n\n   However, in table fact verification tasks, if the table does not contain the information needed to support the statement, and the statement makes a specific claim that is not corroborated, it is typically considered \"refuted\" or at least not supported. Given that the table lists other associated acts and does not include Motley Crue, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is refuted.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{refuted}"

The entry is:\n```\nLabels | United Artists, Jet, Harvest, Epic, Sony BMG, Reprise, Frontiers\n```\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the order of the labels\nThe labels are listed in the following order:\n1. United Artists\n2. Jet\n3. Harvest\n4. Epic\n5. Sony BMG\n6. Reprise\n7. Frontiers\n\nIn such contexts, it is common for the labels to be listed in chronological order (i.e., the order in which the artist was associated with them). However, the table does not explicitly state that the order is chronological.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the statement\nThe statement claims that Jeff Lynne was with Harvest before Epic. In the list, Harvest appears before Epic, which is consistent with the statement. However, without explicit confirmation that the order is chronological, we cannot be certain that this is the case.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the conclusion\nSince the table does not explicitly state that the order of the labels is chronological, we cannot definitively conclude that the statement is entailed.

The only political information given is the name of the current President (Quim Torra) and his party (JuntsxCat), but the ideology of JuntsxCat is not specified. Therefore, there is **not enough information** to verify the claim that Catalonia is \"mostly communist in nature.\"\n\n2. **Republic Representation**: The table mentions that Catalonia is a \"Devolved government in a constitutional monarchy,\" which implies it is part of a larger monarchy (Spain) and not an independent republic. However, the table also notes that Catalonia has representation in the Spanish Congress of Deputies (47 Deputies) and Senate (16 Senators), which could be considered a form of \"republic representation\" within the Spanish system. The statement claims Catalonia \"does not have republic representation,\" which is ambiguous but could be interpreted as lacking representation in a republican system.
