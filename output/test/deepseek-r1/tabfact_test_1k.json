The table provided lists games 33 through 46, where the location column includes **eight entries for Boston Garden** (games 34, 36, 37, 39, 41, 42, 43, and 44). However, the table only covers a subset of the season (14 games). In reality, an NBA season consists of far more games (typically 82), and the Celtics' record in the table (37-9 after game 46) suggests this subset is part of a longer season. Since the table alone shows eight home games in just 14 games, the total season would include many more home games, refuting the claim of exactly eight. \n\nAnswer: \\boxed{refuted}"

While Aldershot Town was indeed the opponent in a 5-0 victory (row 35, where Bradford scored the **most goals** in a single game), the term \"point total\" specifically refers to league points, not goals. Since all wins grant 3 points equally, multiple opponents (e.g., Macclesfield Town, Rochdale) also contributed to this maximum point total.
