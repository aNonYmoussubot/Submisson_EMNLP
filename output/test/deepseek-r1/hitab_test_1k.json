The odds ratio for \"25 to 29 years\" is **2.08 (univariate)** and **1.88 (multivariate)**, both greater than 1.00. These values indicate that the 25\u201329 age group had 2.08 times (unadjusted) and 1.88 times (adjusted) higher odds of being missed compared to the 30\u201334 age group. While the table lacks explicit statistical significance markers (e.g., p-values), the odds ratios substantially exceeding 1.00 (along with a sample size of 937 observations) strongly suggest significance. \n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{\\text{Respondents aged 25 to 29 years}}"

Each industry\u2019s \"difference\" (U.S. - Canada) contributes to the total.\n   - For the specified industry, the difference (U.S. - Canada) is **-3.9**, meaning Canada\u2019s increase in employment share was 3.9 percentage points greater than the U.S.\u2019s.\n\n3. **Attribution Calculation:**\n   - The question asks how much of the total difference (-9.2) is due to Canada\u2019s greater increase in this industry. The answer directly corresponds to the **difference value (-3.9)** for this industry, as it quantifies how much more Canada improved compared to the U.S. in this sector.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{3.9}"
