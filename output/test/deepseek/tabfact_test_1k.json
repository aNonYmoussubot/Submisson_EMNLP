Anderlecht season and their goals in different competitions:\n- **Columns**: Player | League | Title Playoff | Super Cup | Total\n- **Rows**: Each row represents a player's goals in these competitions.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Data\nThe statement mentions:\n1. **Jelle Van Damme's goals**: According to the table, Jelle Van Damme has a total of 3 goals (League: 3, Title Playoff: 0, Super Cup: 0).\n2. **Other players' goals**: The statement refers to \"each of the other two players\" but does not specify which players. However, the table shows multiple players with varying goal totals.\n\n### Step 3: Check the Claim\nThe claim is that Jelle Van Damme scored **three times as much as each of the other two players**. \n\n- For this to be true, the other two players must each have **1 goal** (since 3 is three times 1).\n- Looking at the table:\n  - Many players have totals less than 3, but only **Victor Bern\u00e1rdez** and **Bart Goor** have exactly **1 goal each** (as per the \"Total\" column).\n  - Other players have totals of 2, 3 (same as Van Damme), or more, which would not satisfy the \"three times as much\" condition.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Specific Players\nThe statement does not specify which \"other two players\" are being compared. However, the only players with exactly 1 goal are:\n- Victor Bern\u00e1rdez (Total: 1)\n- Bart Goor (Total: 1)\n- Nemanja Rni\u0107 (Total: 1, but with 0 in all competitions, which might be a typo or mislabeling).\n\nIf the \"other two players\" are **Victor Bern\u00e1rdez** and **Bart Goor**, then:\n- Jelle Van Damme's total (3) is indeed three times their totals (1 each). \n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nSince the table supports that Jelle Van Damme scored three times as much as at least two other players (Victor Bern\u00e1rdez and Bart Goor), the statement is **entailed** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{entailed}"

        "predict": "To determine whether the statement \"Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 15 races in the 1933 Giro d'Italia\" is entailed or refuted by the table, let's analyze the table step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Table Structure\nThe table lists the stages of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, with columns for:\n- **Date**: The day of the race.\n- **Course**: The route of the stage.\n- **Distance**: Not provided for most stages.\n- **Winner**: The winner of the stage.\n- **Race Leader**: The person who led the race after that stage.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of Stages Where Alfredo Binda Was the Race Leader\nWe will go through each row and count how many times \"Alfredo Binda (ita)\" appears in the \"Race Leader\" column.\n\nHere are the stages where Alfredo Binda was the race leader:\n1. 7 May (Turin to Genoa)\n2. 8 May (Genoa to Pisa)\n3. 10 May (Pisa to Florence)\n4. 15 May (Naples to Foggia)\n5. 17 May (Foggia to Chieti)\n6. 18 May (Chieti to Ascoli Piceno)\n7. 20 May (Ascoli Piceno to Riccione)\n8. 21 May (Riccione to Bologna)\n9. 22 May (Bologna to Ferrara)\n10. 24 May (Ferrara to Udine)\n11. 25 May (Udine to Bassano del Grappa)\n12. 26 May (Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano)\n13. 28 May (Bolzano to Milan)\n\nThis gives us a total of **13 stages** where Alfredo Binda was the race leader.\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the Statement\nThe statement claims that Alfredo Binda was the race leader for **15 races**. However, the table shows he was the race leader for **13 races**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince the table does not support the claim of 15 races (only 13), the statement is **refuted**.\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"

Looking at the table:\n- The home teams are: collingwood, carlton, melbourne, south melbourne, north melbourne, and geelong.\n- \"hawthorn\" does not appear as a home team in any row. Instead, \"hawthorn\" appears as the away team in the row where \"melbourne\" is the home team.\n\n### Step 2: Check the Claimed Score\nThe statement claims that when \"hawthorn\" is the home team, the away team's score is \"9.11 (65)\". However:\n- There is no row where \"hawthorn\" is the home team, so the premise of the statement is false.\n- Even if we consider the row where \"hawthorn\" is the away team (against \"melbourne\"), the away team's score is \"5.3 (33)\", not \"9.11 (65)\".\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nSince \"hawthorn\" is never the home team in the table, and the score mentioned (\"9.11 (65)\") does not match any away team's score in the row where \"hawthorn\" is involved, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

There seems to be a discrepancy in the calculation because the initial and final records don't align perfectly with the game results. \n\nBut looking directly at the results of the 10 games:\n- **Wins**: Games 50, 51, 53 \u2192 3 wins\n- **Losses**: Games 47, 48, 49, 52, 54, 55, 56 \u2192 7 losses\n\nThis matches the statement: 3 wins and 7 losses.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Statement\nThe statement claims \"the bobcats had a record of 3 wins and 7 losses,\" which aligns exactly with the wins and losses in the 10 games listed in the table.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe statement is \\boxed{entailed} by the table."

The notations used are:\n- \"a\" (absent or did not participate)\n- \"1r\" (first round)\n- \"2r\" (second round)\n- \"3r\" (third round)\n- \"qf\" (quarterfinals)\n- Other notations like \"nh\" (not held) or \"lq\" (qualifying loss) are not relevant to grand slam finals.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Finals Appearance\nWe need to see if any of the entries indicate that she reached the finals (typically denoted as \"f\" or similar). None of the entries for any grand slam tournament across all years show a result beyond \"3r\" (third round). The highest achievement shown is reaching the third round in the French Open (2008 and 2009).\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the table does not show any instance where Olga Govortsova reached the finals of a grand slam tournament, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"

The table states that Miguel Zapata (goalkeeper for Atl\u00e9tico Ciudad) played 28 matches and had an average of 0.61.\n2. The statement claims that for all 28 matches, the average was never below 0.61.\n3. The table does not provide any information about the average for individual matches or any subset of the 28 matches. It only provides the overall average across all 28 matches.\n4. Since the overall average is 0.61, it is mathematically possible that some matches had averages below 0.61 and others above, as long as the overall average is 0.61. However, the table does not provide this level of detail.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table does not provide enough information to confirm that the average was never below 0.61 for all 28 matches. It only confirms that the overall average is 0.61. Therefore, the statement is **not entailed** by the table. \n\nHowever, the statement is also not directly contradicted (refuted) by the table, since the table does not provide any evidence of an average below 0.61. But in the context of table fact verification, if the statement cannot be confirmed by the table, it is typically considered **refuted** (since the table does not entail it).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

He was not on the team during 1979-80.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the statement\nThe statement claims:\n1. There were at least three guards during 1979-80 (true: Brad Davis, Paul Dawkins, Greg Deane).\n2. One of them was James Donaldson (false: James Donaldson was not a guard and not on the team during 1979-80).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe first part of the statement is correct, but the second part is incorrect. Since the statement includes a false claim, it is **refuted** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"

In **1971**, Alberto Pagani won **two times** (i.e., had two wins in that year).\n2. No other year had **two wins** for Alberto Pagani.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Wins in the Table\nThe table includes a \"wins\" column.

For example:\n- Most years have **0 wins**.\n- 1969 and 1972 have **1 win** each.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Uniqueness of 1971\nOnly **1971** has **two wins** (one for Linto and one for MV Agusta in the 500cc class). No other year matches this.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe table confirms that:\n1. Alberto Pagani had **two wins in 1971**.\n2. No other year had two wins.\n\nThus, the statement is **entailed** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{entailed}"

        "predict": "Let's analyze the statement step by step using the given table.\n\n### Statement Breakdown:\nThe statement claims:  \n\"Jonathan Legear scored four more goals than Matias Suarez, the next highest ranked player in the Belgian First Division A league who played in the Belgian Cup.\"\n\n### Key Points to Verify:\n1. **Jonathan Legear's total goals**: From the table, Jonathan Legear's \"total\" is 7.\n2. **Matias Suarez's total goals**: From the table, Matias Suarez's \"total\" is 3.\n3. **Difference between Legear and Suarez**: 7 (Legear) - 3 (Suarez) = 4. This matches the statement's claim of \"four more goals.\"\n4. **Next highest ranked player in the Belgian First Division A league who played in the Belgian Cup**: The table does not explicitly mention the Belgian Cup, but it lists \"total\" goals across all competitions (league, title playoff, super cup). Since the statement specifies \"next highest ranked player,\" we assume Matias Suarez is the next highest after Jonathan Legear in the context of the table. The table supports this as Suarez's total (3) is the next highest after Legear's (7) among players listed.\n\n### Verification:\n- The difference in total goals between Legear (7) and Suarez (3) is indeed 4.\n- The table does not contradict the claim about the Belgian Cup, though it does not explicitly confirm it either. However, the \"total\" column likely includes all competitions, so the statement's core claim about the goal difference is supported.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table **entails** the statement, as the numerical difference is correct and the ranking context is supported.\n\n\\boxed{entailed}"

There should be no \"NA\" in the \"lifetime achievement\" column for years 1998 or earlier.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n1. **Years 1996-1998 (1998 and earlier)**:\n   - 1996: Lifetime achievement is \"Jon Cleary\" (not NA).\n   - 1997: Lifetime achievement is \"Alan Yates (aka Carter Brown)\" (not NA).\n   - 1998: Lifetime achievement is \"NA\" (this contradicts the statement, as 1998 is not after 1998).\n\n2. **Years after 1998**:\n   - From 1999 onwards, the lifetime achievement column has both names and \"NA\" in some years (e.g., 1999: \"Peter Corris\", 2000: \"NA\", etc.).\n   - The statement claims \"NA won the lifetime achievement only after 1998,\" but the table shows \"NA\" in 1998 (which is not after 1998) and also non-NA values after 1998 (e.g., 1999: \"Peter Corris\").\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement is **refuted** by the table because:\n- \"NA\" appears in the \"lifetime achievement\" column in 1998 (which is not after 1998), contradicting the \"only after 1998\" claim.\n- There are also non-NA values after 1998, which further complicates the interpretation, but the primary refutation is the \"NA\" in 1998.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

        "answer": "refuted",
        "predict": "To determine whether the statement is entailed or refuted by the table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Statement**: The statement claims that the lowest right ascension (RA) in the table is for NGC 1533, with an RA of 4 hours 9 minutes and 51.8 seconds.\n\n2. **Extract RA Values from the Table**: We need to look at the \"ra (j2000)\" column for each row in the table and convert the RA into a comparable format (e.g., total seconds or decimal hours) to find the lowest value.\n\n   Here are the RA values from the table:\n   - NGC 2082: 05h41m51.1s\n   - NGC 1947: 05h26m47.6s\n   - NGC 1796: 05h02m42.5s\n   - NGC 1688: 04h48m23.8s\n   - NGC 1672: 04h45m42.5s\n   - IC 2056: 04h16m24.5s\n   - NGC 1559: 04h17m35.8s\n   - NGC 1543: 04h12m43.2s\n   - NGC 1574: 04h21m58.8s\n   - NGC 1533: 04h09m51.8s\n   - NGC 1546: 04h14m36.5s\n   - NGC 1553: 04h16m10.5s\n   - NGC 1549: 04h15m45.1s\n   - NGC 1566: 04h20m00.4s\n   - NGC 1617: 04h31m39.5s\n   - NGC 1515: 04h04m02.7s\n   - NGC 1705: 04h54m13.5s\n   - NGC 1596: 04h27m38.1s\n\n3. **Convert RA to Comparable Format**: Convert each RA to total seconds for easier comparison. For example:\n   - NGC 1533: 04h09m51.8s = (4 * 3600) + (9 * 60) + 51.8 = 14400 + 540 + 51.8 = 14991.8 seconds\n   - NGC 1515: 04h04m02.7s = (4 * 3600) + (4 * 60) + 2.7 = 14400 + 240 + 2.7 = 14642.7 seconds\n\n4. **Find the Lowest RA**: Compare all the converted RA values. The lowest value corresponds to the lowest RA.\n   - The smallest value is for NGC 1515 with 14642.7 seconds (04h04m02.7s), not NGC 1533 (14991.8 seconds).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The statement claims that NGC 1533 has the lowest RA, but the table shows that NGC 1515 has a lower RA (04h04m02.7s vs. 04h09m51.8s). Therefore, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"

A \"tie for the largest point gap\" implies that there are multiple games where the point gap is the same and is the highest observed in the season.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Point Gaps from the Table\nFrom the table, we extract the scores and compute the point gaps (absolute difference between the two scores) for each game where there was a clear winner (i.e., excluding ties):\n\n1. January 2: Detroit 4 - 1 Carolina \u2192 Point gap: 3\n2. January 3: Anaheim 1 - 3 Detroit \u2192 Point gap: 2\n3. January 5: Nashville 0 - 6 Detroit \u2192 Point gap: 6\n4.

January 29: New Jersey 2 - 5 Detroit \u2192 Point gap: 3\n\n(Note: Games ending in a tie, e.g., Phoenix 3 - 3 Detroit, are excluded as they do not contribute to a point gap.)\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Largest Point Gap\nFrom the computed point gaps: 3, 2, 6, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, the largest point gap is **6** (from the game on January 5: Nashville 0 - 6 Detroit).\n\n### Step 4: Check for Ties for the Largest Point Gap\nThe largest point gap is 6, and it occurs **only once** (on January 5). There are no other games with a point gap of 6. \n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe statement claims that there was a tie for the largest point gap **two times**, but the table shows that the largest point gap (6) occurred only once. Therefore, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

Let's calculate the time ranges for all other entries:\n\n1. **kotonishiki**  \n   - First: September 1990  \n   - Last: September 1999  \n   - Range: 1999 - 1990 = **9 years**\n\n2. **kai\u014d**  \n   - First: May 1994  \n   - Last: July 2000  \n   - Range: 2000 - 1994 = **6 years**\n\n3. **mus\u014dyama**  \n   - First: March 1994  \n   - Last: September 2000  \n   - Range: 2000 - 1994 = **6 years**\n\n4. **hasegawa**  \n   - First: November 1965  \n   - Last: September 1974  \n   - Range: 1974 - 1965 = **9 years**\n\n5. **kotomitsuki**  \n   - First: January 2001  \n   - Last: July 2007  \n   - Range: 2007 - 2001 = **6 years**\n\n6. **akinoshima**  \n   - First: November 1988  \n   - Last: September 2000  \n   - Range: 2000 - 1988 = **12 years**\n\n7. **takat\u014driki**  \n   - First: May 1991  \n   - Last: May 2000  \n   - Range: 2000 - 1991 = **9 years**\n\n8. **wakanosato**  \n   - First: November 2000  \n   - Last: September 2005  \n   - Range: 2005 - 2000 = **5 years**\n\n9. **daikirin**  \n   - First: November 1966  \n   - Last: September 1970  \n   - Range: 1970 - 1966 = **4 years**\n\n10. **tochiazuma ii**  \n    - First: July 1997  \n    - Last: January 2005  \n    - Range: 2005 - 1997 = **8 years**\n\n11. **kisenosato**  \n    - First: July 2006  \n    - Last: September 2011  \n    - Range: 2011 - 2006 = **5 years**\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Shortest Time Range\nFrom the calculations:\n- The shortest time range is **4 years** (daikirin), followed by **5 years** (wakanosato and kisenosato), and so on.\n- Takamiyama's time range is **13 years**, which is **not the shortest**.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe statement claims that takamiyama had the shortest time range (13 years), but the table shows that other sumo record holders (e.g., daikirin with 4 years) have shorter time ranges. Therefore, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"

Each row represents a game in the 2004 Cleveland Browns season.\n\n2. **Locate the October 17, 2004 Game**: \n   - Scan the \"date\" column to find the row where the date is \"october 17 , 2004\".\n   - This corresponds to **row 6** in the table.\n\n3. **Check the Week Number for the October 17, 2004 Game**:\n   - In **row 6**, the \"week\" column is \"6\", and the \"date\" column is \"october 17 , 2004\".\n   - This confirms that the game played on October 17, 2004, was indeed in **week 6**.\n\n4. **Verify the Statement**:\n   - The statement claims that \"week 6 was when the october 17 , 2004 game was played\".\n   - The table explicitly shows that the October 17, 2004 game is listed under week 6.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table **entails** the statement, as the data directly supports the claim.\n\n\\boxed{entailed}"

This implies that on September 4, 2009, Sanya Richards set the record to 48.83. \n   - Therefore, **before September 4, 2009**, the record must have been **worse (slower) than 48.83** (i.e., higher numerically if we're considering time, since a lower time is better in track events).

Here are the values:\n   - 1995: 24.0\n   - 1996: 26.4\n   - 1997: 27.1\n   - 1998: 24.9\n   - 1999: 25.8\n   - 2000: 35.0\n   - 2001: 27.9\n   - 2002: 27.0\n   - 2003: 35.8\n   - 2004: 31.4\n   - 2005: 40.9\n   - 2006: 38.9\n   - 2008: 43.0\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of Finish Positions**:\n   Sum all the finish positions:\n   \\[\n   24.0 + 26.4 + 27.1 + 24.9 + 25.8 + 35.0 + 27.9 + 27.0 + 35.8 + 31.4 + 40.9 + 38.9 + 43.0 = 387.1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the Number of Years**:\n   There are 13 years listed in the table (from 1995 to 2008, excluding 2007 as it's not present).\n\n4. **Compute the Average Finish Position**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Finish} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of Finish Positions}}{\\text{Number of Years}} = \\frac{387.1}{13} \\approx 29.78\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compare with the Given Statement**:\n   The calculated average finish is approximately **29.78**, which does **not** match the stated average of **33.39**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{refuted}}"

        "predict": "To determine whether the statement \"the highest scoring team for the games that happened on the 18th of June was Carlton\" is entailed or refuted by the table, let's analyze the scores of all the teams that played on that date.\n\n### Step 1: List the scores for each team on 18th June 1938\n1. **Geelong**: 11.23 (89)  \n   - Calculation: 11 goals \u00d7 6 points = 66, plus 23 behinds \u00d7 1 point = 23. Total = 66 + 23 = **89 points**.\n\n2. **Hawthorn**: 6.13 (49)  \n   - Calculation: 6 \u00d7 6 = 36, plus 13 \u00d7 1 = 13. Total = 36 + 13 = **49 points**.\n\n3. **Fitzroy**: 16.12 (108)  \n   - Calculation: 16 \u00d7 6 = 96, plus 12 \u00d7 1 = 12. Total = 96 + 12 = **108 points**.\n\n4. **South Melbourne**: 8.8 (56)  \n   - Calculation: 8 \u00d7 6 = 48, plus 8 \u00d7 1 = 8. Total = 48 + 8 = **56 points**.\n\n5. **St Kilda**: 14.12 (96)  \n   - Calculation: 14 \u00d7 6 = 84, plus 12 \u00d7 1 = 12. Total = 84 + 12 = **96 points**.\n\n6. **Melbourne**: 16.16 (112)  \n   - Calculation: 16 \u00d7 6 = 96, plus 16 \u00d7 1 = 16. Total = 96 + 16 = **112 points**.\n\n7. **Richmond**: 15.14 (104)  \n   - Calculation: 15 \u00d7 6 = 90, plus 14 \u00d7 1 = 14. Total = 90 + 14 = **104 points**.\n\n8. **Essendon**: 15.9 (99)  \n   - Calculation: 15 \u00d7 6 = 90, plus 9 \u00d7 1 = 9. Total = 90 + 9 = **99 points**.\n\n9. **Footscray**: 13.9 (87)  \n   - Calculation: 13 \u00d7 6 = 78, plus 9 \u00d7 1 = 9. Total = 78 + 9 = **87 points**.\n\n10. **Collingwood**: 10.5 (65)  \n    - Calculation: 10 \u00d7 6 = 60, plus 5 \u00d7 1 = 5. Total = 60 + 5 = **65 points**.\n\n11. **North Melbourne**: 11.5 (71)  \n    - Calculation: 11 \u00d7 6 = 66, plus 5 \u00d7 1 = 5. Total = 66 + 5 = **71 points**.\n\n12. **Carlton**: 16.25 (121)  \n    - Calculation: 16 \u00d7 6 = 96, plus 25 \u00d7 1 = 25. Total = 96 + 25 = **121 points**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the highest score\nFrom the calculations above, the scores are:\n- Carlton: 121 points\n- Melbourne: 112 points\n- Fitzroy: 108 points\n- Richmond: 104 points\n- Essendon: 99 points\n- St Kilda: 96 points\n- Geelong: 89 points\n- Footscray: 87 points\n- North Melbourne: 71 points\n- South Melbourne: 56 points\n- Hawthorn: 49 points\n- Collingwood: 65 points\n\n**Carlton has the highest score of 121 points.**\n\n### Step 3: Verify the statement\nThe statement claims that \"the highest scoring team for the games that happened on the 18th of June was Carlton.\" This matches the table's data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{entailed}"

        "predict": "Let's analyze the statement step by step using the information provided in the table.\n\n### Statement Breakdown:\nThe statement claims: \"the Yugoslavian national team lost the Italy against Romania with an aggregate score of 3:4.\" \n\nThis implies two things:\n1. Yugoslavia played against Italy and Romania in some context (likely two separate games).\n2. The combined (aggregate) score of these two games was 3:4 in favor of the opponents (Italy and Romania).\n\n### Table Analysis:\nFrom the table, we can extract the following relevant matches:\n1. **March 30**: Yugoslavia vs Romania - Result: 2:0 (Balkan Cup)\n   - Yugoslavia scored 2, Romania scored 0.\n2. **August 27**: Yugoslavia vs Romania - Result: 1:4 (Balkan Cup)\n   - Yugoslavia scored 1, Romania scored 4.\n3. **November 15**: Yugoslavia vs Italy - Result: 0:2 (1982 WCQ)\n   - Yugoslavia scored 0, Italy scored 2.\n\n### Aggregate Calculation:\nThe statement mentions \"Italy against Romania,\" but the table shows separate matches against Italy and Romania. To compute the aggregate score:\n1. Matches against Romania: \n   - March 30: 2-0 (Yugoslavia won)\n   - August 27: 1-4 (Romania won)\n   - Total goals: Yugoslavia = 2 + 1 = 3; Romania = 0 + 4 = 4.\n   - Aggregate against Romania: 3:4 (Yugoslavia lost on aggregate).\n2. Match against Italy:\n   - November 15: 0-2 (Italy won).\n   - This is a standalone match, not part of an aggregate with Romania.\n\n### Verifying the Statement:\nThe statement says \"lost the Italy against Romania with an aggregate score of 3:4.\" This is ambiguous, but the most plausible interpretation is:\n- The aggregate score of Yugoslavia's matches against Romania is 3:4 (which is correct, as shown above).\n- The mention of \"Italy\" might be misleading, as the aggregate is only against Romania. The match against Italy is separate and not part of this aggregate.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table supports that Yugoslavia's aggregate score against Romania is 3:4 (a loss), which matches the statement. The mention of \"Italy\" in the statement is either a mistake or irrelevant to the aggregate calculation. \n\nThus, the statement is **entailed** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{entailed}"

However, the \"points\" column in the table does not represent the opponents' points; it represents the points of the team whose record is being shown in the table.\n   - The Chicago Black Hawks appear as an opponent in row 74, where the \"points\" value is 67 (not 63). There is no other mention of the Chicago Black Hawks in the table.\n\n3. **Checking for Other Opponents with 63 Points:**\n   - The \"points\" column shows the following values for the team in the table:\n     - 59, 60, 60, 61, 61, 63, 65, 65, 66, 66, 67, 67, 69.\n   - The value 63 appears only once (in row 68), where the opponent is the Toronto Maple Leafs. This means the team in the table had 63 points after that game, not the opponent.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The Chicago Black Hawks are never associated with 63 points in the table. The only time 63 points appear is for the team in the table (not an opponent).\n   - Therefore, the statement is incorrect because:\n     - The Chicago Black Hawks do not have 63 points in the table.\n     - The team in the table has 63 points in one row, but this is not related to the opponents.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statement is \\boxed{refuted} by the table."

        "predict": "Let's analyze the statement step by step to determine if it is entailed or refuted by the table.\n\n### Statement Breakdown:\n1. **\"The position of the player born 2 November 1987 was fly-half\"**:\n   - From the table, the player born on \"2 november 1987\" is **Danny Cipriani**.\n   - His position is indeed listed as **fly-half**. So, this part of the statement is correct.\n\n2. **\"the only one for a Sale player\"**:\n   - This implies that among all players whose club/province is \"Sale\", Danny Cipriani is the only fly-half.\n   - From the table, the Sale players are:\n     - Andrew Sheridan (prop)\n     - Magnus Lund (flanker)\n     - Charlie Hodgson (fly-half)\n     - Richard Wigglesworth (scrum-half)\n     - Mark Cueto (fullback)\n   - **Charlie Hodgson** is also a **fly-half** and plays for Sale. This contradicts the claim that Danny Cipriani is the \"only one\" (fly-half for Sale), since Charlie Hodgson is another Sale fly-half.\n   - Additionally, Danny Cipriani's club is listed as \"Wasps\", not \"Sale\". So, he is not even a Sale player.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The first part of the statement (about Danny Cipriani's position) is correct, but the second part (about him being the only fly-half for Sale) is incorrect because:\n  1. Danny Cipriani is not a Sale player (he is with Wasps).\n  2. Charlie Hodgson is a Sale player and also a fly-half.\n- Therefore, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

This indicates the score was not decided or recorded in the table.\n   - In the row for **2016**, the Air Force-Navy score is listed as \"tbd\" (to be decided), meaning it was not decided at the time the table was created.\n   - In the row for **2018**, the Air Force-Navy score is also listed as \"tbd\", indicating it was not decided.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The table clearly shows that for the years 2014, 2016, and 2018, the Air Force-Navy scores were either not decided or not recorded numerically.

Each row represents a game with the following columns:\n- **Year**: The year the game was played.\n- **Date**: The date of the game.\n- **Winner**: The team that won the game.\n- **Result**: The score of the game.\n- **Loser**: The team that lost the game.\n- **Attendance**: Number of attendees.\n- **Location**: Where the game was played.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Games Where the Chicago Bears Were the Losers\nWe need to count how many times the \"Loser\" column lists \"Chicago Bears\" in the table. Here are the relevant rows:\n\n1. **1950** (Sunday, October 1):  \n   - **Loser**: Chicago Bears  \n   - **Winner**: Green Bay Packers  \n   - **Result**: 31-21  \n\n2. **1955** (Sunday, October 2):  \n   - **Loser**: Chicago Bears  \n   - **Winner**: Green Bay Packers  \n   - **Result**: 24-3  \n\n3. **1957** (Sunday, September 29):  \n   - **Loser**: Chicago Bears  \n   - **Winner**: Green Bay Packers  \n   - **Result**: 21-17  \n\n4. **1959** (Sunday, September 27):  \n   - **Loser**: Chicago Bears  \n   - **Winner**: Green Bay Packers  \n   - **Result**: 9-6  \n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of Times the Chicago Bears Were the Losers\nFrom the above, the Chicago Bears lost to the Green Bay Packers **4 times** in the given data.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Statement\nThe statement claims that the Chicago Bears were the losers against the Green Bay Packers **more than ten times**.

Here, we are interested in the game where **Bradford City** scored the most goals.\n\n### Step 3: Find Bradford City's Highest Goal Count\nWe need to look at the \"result\" column for all rows where Bradford City is the home team (venue = \"home\") or the away team (venue = \"away\") and note the goals scored by Bradford City.\n\n- **Home Games**: The result is listed as \"X - Y\", where X is Bradford City's goals, and Y is the opponent's goals.\n- **Away Games**: The result is listed as \"Y - X\", where Y is the opponent's goals, and X is Bradford City's goals.\n\nWe will scan the \"result\" column to find the highest number of goals scored by Bradford City.\n\n### Step 4: Scan the Table for Highest Goals\nLooking through the \"result\" column:\n- Row 6: Exeter City (home) - 4 - 1 \u2192 Bradford scored 4 goals.\n- Row 23: Morecambe (home) - 4 - 0 \u2192 Bradford scored 4 goals.\n- Row 35: Aldershot Town (home) - 5 - 0 \u2192 Bradford scored 5 goals.\n\nNo other rows show Bradford scoring more than 5 goals. \n\n### Step 5: Identify the Opponent in the Highest-Scoring Game\nThe highest-scoring game is Row 35:\n- Opponent: Aldershot Town\n- Result: 5 - 0 (Bradford scored 5 goals).\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Statement\nThe statement claims that Aldershot Town was the opponent when Bradford City scored their highest point total. From the table:\n- The highest point total (goals) was 5.\n- This occurred against Aldershot Town (Row 35).\n\nThus, the statement is **correct**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{entailed}"

Sweden and Canada did not receive medals in two of the three categories (gold, silver, bronze).\n2. No other country in the table has this property (i.e., all other countries received medals in at least two categories or did not meet the condition).\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Medal Categories:\nThe table has three medal categories: gold, silver, and bronze. \n\n### Step 2: Check Sweden's Medals:\n- Sweden (row 5): gold = 4, silver = 0, bronze = 2.\n  - Sweden did not receive any silver medals (one category with 0 medals).\n  - It received gold and bronze medals (two categories with >0 medals).\n  - So, Sweden did not receive medals in **one** category (silver), not two.\n\n### Step 3: Check Canada's Medals:\n- Canada (row 13): gold = 0, silver = 2, bronze = 3.\n  - Canada did not receive any gold medals (one category with 0 medals).\n  - It received silver and bronze medals (two categories with >0 medals).\n  - So, Canada did not receive medals in **one** category (gold), not two.\n\n### Step 4: Check Other Countries:\nThe statement claims that Sweden and Canada are the **only** countries with this property, but we've already seen that neither Sweden nor Canada missed medals in two categories. However, let's check if any other country missed medals in two categories:\n- All other countries in the table have at least two medal categories with >0 medals. For example:\n  - Soviet Union: gold, silver, bronze > 0 (missed 0 categories).\n  - East Germany: gold, silver, bronze > 0 (missed 0 categories).\n  - Switzerland: gold, silver, bronze > 0 (missed 0 categories).\n  - Finland: gold = 4, silver = 1, bronze = 2 (missed 0 categories).\n  - Austria: gold = 3, silver = 5, bronze = 2 (missed 0 categories).\n  - Netherlands: gold = 3, silver = 2, bronze = 2 (missed 0 categories).\n  - West Germany: gold = 2, silver = 4, bronze = 2 (missed 0 categories).\n  - United States: gold = 2, silver = 1, bronze = 3 (missed 0 categories).\n  - Italy: gold = 2, silver = 1, bronze = 2 (missed 0 categories).\n\nNo country in the table missed medals in two categories. \n\n### Step 5: Conclusion:\nThe statement claims that Sweden and Canada were the only countries that did not receive medals in two categories, but:\n1. Sweden did not receive medals in only one category (silver).\n2. Canada did not receive medals in only one category (gold).\n3. No country in the table missed medals in two categories.\n\nThus, the statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the number of categories Sweden and Canada missed (they missed one, not two) and falsely claims they were the only ones with this property.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

        "predict": "To determine whether the statement \"seven viral families have an icosahedral virion shape\" is entailed or refuted by the table, let's analyze the table step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Table Structure\nThe table lists various viral families along with their attributes, one of which is \"virion shape.\" The possible shapes mentioned in the table include:\n- Icosahedral\n- Complex\n- Helical\n- Spherical\n- Bullet shaped\n\n### Step 2: Count the Viral Families with Icosahedral Virion Shape\nWe will go through each row and count the families where the \"virion shape\" is \"icosahedral\":\n\n1. **Adenoviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **1**\n2. **Herpesviridae**: complex \u2192 Not icosahedral\n3. **Papillomaviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **2**\n4. **Polyomaviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **3**\n5. **Poxviridae**: complex \u2192 Not icosahedral\n6. **Hepadnaviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **4**\n7. **Parvoviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **5**\n8. **Astroviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **6**\n9. **Caliciviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **7**\n10. **Picornaviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **8**\n11. **Coronaviridae**: helical \u2192 Not icosahedral\n12. **Flaviviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **9**\n13. **Togaviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **10**\n14. **Hepeviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **11**\n15. **Retroviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **12**\n16. **Orthomyxoviridae**: helical \u2192 Not icosahedral\n17. **Arenaviridae**: helical \u2192 Not icosahedral\n18. **Bunyaviridae**: helical \u2192 Not icosahedral\n19. **Filoviridae**: helical \u2192 Not icosahedral\n20. **Paramyxoviridae**: helical \u2192 Not icosahedral\n21. **Rhabdoviridae**: helical, bullet shaped \u2192 Not icosahedral\n22. **Unassigned**: spherical \u2192 Not icosahedral\n23. **Reoviridae**: icosahedral \u2192 **13**\n\n### Step 3: Total Count\nFrom the above, the viral families with icosahedral virion shape are:\n1. Adenoviridae\n2. Papillomaviridae\n3. Polyomaviridae\n4. Hepadnaviridae\n5. Parvoviridae\n6. Astroviridae\n7. Caliciviridae\n8. Picornaviridae\n9. Flaviviridae\n10. Togaviridae\n11. Hepeviridae\n12. Retroviridae\n13. Reoviridae\n\nThis totals **13 viral families** with icosahedral virion shape, not 7.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Statement\nThe statement claims that **7 viral families** have an icosahedral virion shape. However, the table shows **13 such families**. Therefore, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{refuted}"

The phrase \"more fewer than 20000\" is a bit confusing, but it likely means \"fewer than 20000\" or \"less than 20000.\" So, the statement can be interpreted as: \n\"No game on the 18th of June drew a crowd of fewer than 20000.\"\n\n### Table Analysis:\nThe table lists all the games played on the 18th of June 1938, along with their crowd numbers. Here are the crowd numbers for each game:\n1. Geelong vs Hawthorn: 7000\n2. Fitzroy vs South Melbourne: 12000\n3. St Kilda vs Melbourne: 14000\n4. Richmond vs Essendon: 20000\n5. Footscray vs Collingwood: 18000\n6. North Melbourne vs Carlton: 13000\n\n### Verification:\nThe statement claims that no game had a crowd fewer than 20000. However, looking at the table:\n- All games except Richmond vs Essendon (20000) have crowds fewer than 20000 (7000, 12000, 14000, 18000, 13000).\n\nThus, the statement is incorrect because most games had crowds fewer than 20000. \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"

        "predict": "### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the task is asking. We have a table with information about volumes, discs, episodes, and release dates across different regions. The statement we need to verify is:\n\n\"On march 15, 2007 and in region 2 the highest number of episodes is 3.\"\n\nOur goal is to determine if this statement is **entailed** (meaning the table supports the statement) or **refuted** (meaning the table contradicts the statement) by the given table.\n\n### Analyzing the Table Structure\n\nLet's break down the table to understand its structure:\n\n- **Columns**: volume | discs | episodes | region 1 | region 2 | region 4\n- **Rows**: There are 5 rows, each representing a different entry.\n\n### Extracting Relevant Information\n\nThe statement mentions two key pieces of information:\n1. A specific date: \"march 15, 2007\"\n2. A region: \"region 2\"\n\nAdditionally, it claims that the \"highest number of episodes is 3\" under these conditions.\n\n#### Step 1: Find the Row with March 15, 2007\n\nLooking at the table, the date \"march 15, 2007\" appears in the first row under the \"region 4\" column. \n\nWait a minute\u2014the statement mentions \"region 2,\" but the date \"march 15, 2007\" is under \"region 4.\" \n\nThis seems like a potential mismatch. But let's double-check:\n\n- **Row 1**: region 1: january 31, 2006 | region 2: february 19, 2007 | region 4: march 15, 2007\n- **Row 2**: region 1: march 28, 2006 | region 2: june 4, 2007 | region 4: july 5, 2007\n- And so on...\n\nIndeed, \"march 15, 2007\" is only in \"region 4,\" not \"region 2.\" \n\n#### Step 2: Check Region 2 Dates\n\nNow, let's look at all dates in \"region 2\":\n\n- Row 1: february 19, 2007\n- Row 2: june 4, 2007\n- Row 3: september 3, 2007\n- Row 4: february 18, 2008\n- Row 5: may 26, 2008\n\nNone of these dates match \"march 15, 2007.\" \n\n#### Step 3: Verify the Episodes Claim\n\nThe statement also claims that the \"highest number of episodes is 3\" for the given date and region. \n\nLooking at the \"episodes\" column across all rows, every row has \"4\" episodes. \n\n- Row 1: 4 episodes\n- Row 2: 4 episodes\n- ...\n- Row 5: 4 episodes\n\nThere is no entry with 3 episodes; the minimum (and only) number of episodes listed is 4.\n\n### Cross-Referencing the Statement with the Table\n\nGiven that:\n1. The date \"march 15, 2007\" does not appear in \"region 2\" at all\u2014it's in \"region 4.\"\n2. Even if we ignore the region, the highest number of episodes is consistently 4, not 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement makes two claims:\n1. That \"march 15, 2007\" is a date in \"region 2\" \u2014 which is false.\n2. That the highest number of episodes is 3 \u2014 which is also false since all entries have 4 episodes.\n\nSince both parts of the statement are contradicted by the table, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"

We have a table about the 1992-93 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n, and a statement that we need to verify against this table. The statement is:\n\n\"36 of 1991 - 92 has a 1993 - 94 smaller than 34, and a team of estudiantes de la plata.\"\n\nOur goal is to determine if this statement is **entailed** (meaning the table supports the statement) or **refuted** (meaning the table contradicts the statement) by the given table.\n\n### Breaking Down the Statement\n\nThe statement is a bit complex, so let's break it down:\n\n1. **\"36 of 1991 - 92\"**: This likely refers to a team that scored 36 points in the 1991-92 season.\n2. **\"has a 1993 - 94 smaller than 34\"**: This means that the same team's points in the 1993-94 season are less than 34.\n3. **\"and a team of estudiantes de la plata\"**: This seems to imply that the team in question is \"Estudiantes de La Plata.\"\n\nSo, the statement is saying: \"Estudiantes de La Plata scored 36 points in 1991-92 and less than 34 points in 1993-94.\"\n\n### Locating the Relevant Data in the Table\n\nNow, let's find \"Estudiantes de La Plata\" in the table and check their points for the mentioned seasons.\n\nLooking at the table, the row for \"Estudiantes de La Plata\" is:\n\n```\nrow : estudiantes de la plata | 0.93 | 106 | 114 | 39 | 29 | 38 |\n```\n\nThe columns are:\n- team\n- average\n- points\n- played\n- 1991 - 92\n- 1992 - 93\n- 1993 - 94\n\nSo, for \"Estudiantes de La Plata\":\n- 1991-92 points: 39\n- 1993-94 points: 38\n\n### Verifying the Statement\n\nNow, let's check the statement's claims:\n\n1. **\"36 of 1991 - 92\"**: The statement says the team scored 36 in 1991-92, but the table shows 39. This is incorrect.\n2. **\"has a 1993 - 94 smaller than 34\"**: The table shows 38 in 1993-94, which is not smaller than 34 (38 > 34). This is also incorrect.\n3. **\"a team of estudiantes de la plata\"**: The team is correctly identified as \"Estudiantes de La Plata.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement claims that Estudiantes de La Plata had:\n- 36 points in 1991-92 (actual: 39)\n- less than 34 in 1993-94 (actual: 38)\n\nBoth numerical claims are incorrect based on the table.

        "predict": "To determine whether the statement \"the Boston Celtics only lost three games in the 1984-85 season\" is entailed or refuted by the given table, let's analyze the table step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Table Structure\nThe table lists games from the 1984-85 Boston Celtics season, including the game number, date, opponent, score, location, and the team's record after each game. The record is presented in the format \"Wins - Losses.\"\n\n### Step 2: Identify Losses in the Table\nWe need to look for games where the Celtics lost. A loss is indicated when the \"record\" column shows an increase in the number of losses compared to the previous game. Here are the relevant rows where the Celtics lost:\n\n1. **Row 40**: Indiana Pacers - Record changes from 33-6 to 33-7 (1 loss).\n2. **Row 42**: Seattle SuperSonics - Record changes from 34-7 to 34-8 (1 loss).\n3. **Row 46**: Philadelphia 76ers - Record changes from 37-8 to 37-9 (1 loss).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Losses\nFrom the above, there are **3 losses** recorded in the table:\n- Loss to Indiana Pacers (Row 40)\n- Loss to Seattle SuperSonics (Row 42)\n- Loss to Philadelphia 76ers (Row 46)\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Statement\nThe statement claims that the Celtics \"only lost three games\" in the 1984-85 season. The table shows exactly 3 losses within the provided data. However, it's important to note that the table may not include all games of the season (it only shows games 33 to 46). \n\nSince the table does not provide the full season's data, we cannot conclusively say that the Celtics only lost 3 games in the entire season. But based on the given table, the statement is **consistent with the data** (i.e., the table does not refute the statement). \n\n### Final Answer\nThe statement is **entailed** by the table, as the table shows only 3 losses in the provided games. \n\n\\boxed{entailed}"

If the statement is interpreted as a general claim about the tournament (without specifying the year), it is partially correct but not universally true for all instances. \n\nBut based on the strict definition of entailment (whether the statement is supported by the table), the statement is entailed because there exists at least one instance in the table where the margin was 3 strokes. \n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{entailed}"

We look for players with a total of 3:\n- Lucas Biglia: 3\n- Dmitri Bulykin: 3\n- Jan Pol\u00e1k: 3\n- Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez: 3\n- Jelle Van Damme: 3\n\nThere are **five players** with a total of 3 goals, not four. This already contradicts the first part of the statement.\n\n### Step 2: Check if all four (or five) are in league 4.\nThe \"league\" column shows the league goals for each player. The statement mentions \"league 4,\" but the table does not explicitly state which league the players are in. Instead, the \"league\" column represents the number of goals scored in the league, not the league number. For example:\n- Lucas Biglia: league goals = 2\n- Dmitri Bulykin: league goals = 3\n- Jan Pol\u00e1k: league goals = 2\n- Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez: league goals = 1\n- Jelle Van Damme: league goals = 3\n\nNone of these values are 4, so the second part of the statement is also incorrect.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion.\nThe statement claims:\n- There are four players with a total of 3 goals (actual: five).\n- All four are in league 4 (actual: none have 4 league goals, and \"league 4\" is not referenced in the table).\n\nBoth parts of the statement are false based on the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

The table lists players grouped by their positions (e.g., \"t1\", \"t3\", \"t9\"), where \"t\" likely stands for \"tied.\"\n2. For each position, we check how many players share that position:\n   - \"t1\" (1st place): 2 players (Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez and Nick Job)\n   - \"t3\" (3rd place): 7 players (Isao Aoki, David Graham, Tony Jacklin, Johnny Miller, Simon Owen, Hal Sutton, and Simon Owen)\n   - \"t9\" (9th place): 9 players (Howard Clark, Ben Crenshaw, David Jagger, Mark James, Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, Sam Torrance)\n3. There is no position in the table where only one player holds a unique position. Every position has at least two players tied.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table confirms that at every position, multiple players are tied. Therefore, the statement is **entailed** by the table.\n\n\\boxed{entailed}"

This is a minor discrepancy, but the key point is that sco has more transfers than all other nationalities combined (23 > 11).\n\n4. **Check if the statement is entailed or refuted:**\n   - The statement is mostly correct in asserting that sco has more transfers than all other nationalities combined, but the exact number is slightly off (23 vs. 22). However, the core claim (sco > others combined) is true.\n   - Since the table supports the main idea of the statement, it is **entailed**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{entailed}"

The seasons are:\n- 1997 - 98\n- 1998 - 99\n- 1999 - 00\n- 2000 - 01\n- 2001 - 02\n- 2002 - 03\n- 2003 - 04\n- 2005\n- 2011\n\nThere is no explicit \"season 5\" in the table. However, if we assume \"season 5\" refers to the 5th season listed (2001 - 02), we can proceed with that.\n\n### Step 2: Check Events in Season 2001 - 02\nThe events in the 2001 - 02 season are:\n1. grand prix | hong kong | limited | 17 - 18 november 2001 | 3\n2. masters | san diego | standard | 11 - 13 january 2002 | 7\n3. grand prix | fukuoka | limited | 16 - 17 february 2002 | 6\n4. grand prix | nagoya | team limited | 11 - 12 may 2002 | 4\n\nThe last 2 events in this season were held in:\n- Fukuoka (16 - 17 february 2002)\n- Nagoya (11 - 12 may 2002)\n\nNeither of these is in Los Angeles or London. \n\n### Step 3: Check Other Interpretations of \"Season 5\"\nIf \"season 5\" refers to the year 2005 (the 8th entry in the list), the events in 2005 are:\n1. grand prix | seattle | extended | 5 - 6 march 2005 | 7\n2. invitational | los angeles | special | 17 - 20 may 2005 | 2\n3. pro tour | london | booster draft | 8 - 10 july 2005 | 2\n4. pro tour | los angeles | extended | 28 - 30 october 2005 | 5\n\nThe last 2 events in 2005 were held in:\n- London (8 - 10 july 2005)\n- Los Angeles (28 - 30 october 2005)\n\nThis matches the statement. \n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe statement is correct if \"season 5\" refers to the year 2005. However, the table does not explicitly label seasons numerically (e.g., \"season 1\", \"season 2\", etc.), so this interpretation is not directly supported by the table. \n\nGiven the ambiguity in the term \"season 5\", the statement is not clearly entailed by the table. However, if we assume \"season 5\" refers to the year 2005, the statement is correct. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit labeling, the most precise answer is that the statement is **not entailed** by the table (since \"season 5\" is not defined). \n\nHowever, if we interpret \"season 5\" as the 5th entry (2001 - 02), the statement is **refuted** because the last 2 events were in Fukuoka and Nagoya, not Los Angeles and London. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest answer is that the statement is **refuted** because the most direct interpretation (5th season = 2001 - 02) does not support it. \n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

However:\n- There is only **one game** (Port Autonome vs Sporting Clube da Praia) where both legs are 0 - 0.\n- There are **three legs** in total with 0 - 0 (not two).\n\nThus, the statement is incorrect because:\n1.

        "question": "The statement is: the screening completed on 30 june 2006 was started five months after the screening that was completed on 4 october 2006. Is it entailed or refuted by the table above?",
        "answer": "refuted",
        "predict": "### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, I need to understand the task at hand. We have a table with several columns and rows, and a statement that makes a claim about the data in the table. The goal is to determine whether the statement is **entailed** (i.e., supported by the table) or **refuted** (i.e., contradicted by the table) based on the information provided.\n\n### Analyzing the Table Structure\n\nThe table has the following columns:\n1. **screening started**\n2. **screening completed**\n3. **chapter unfrozen**\n4. **chapter opened**\n5. **chapter closed**\n\nThere are multiple rows, each representing a different screening event with dates for when the screening started and completed, and other related information.\n\n### Understanding the Statement\n\nThe statement is: \n*\"the screening completed on 30 june 2006 was started five months after the screening that was completed on 4 october 2006.\"*\n\nBreaking it down:\n1. There's a screening completed on **30 June 2006**.\n2. There's another screening completed on **4 October 2006**.\n3. The screening completed on 30 June 2006 was started **five months after** the screening completed on 4 October 2006.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Screening Completed on 30 June 2006\n\nLooking at the table, we need to find a row where \"screening completed\" is \"30 june 2006\". \n\nHowever, scanning through the rows:\n- The dates under \"screening completed\" are: 22 december 2005, 20 july 2006, 3 march 2006, 14 july 2006, 28 april 2006, 12 july 2006, 23 march 2006, 18 july 2006, 22 march 2006, 5 may 2006, 29 september 2006, 10 october 2006, 13 october 2006, 14 november 2005, 2 june 2006, 11 july 2006, 30 june 2006.\n\nWait, the last row has \"30 june 2006\" under \"screening completed\". \n\nBut looking at the corresponding \"screening started\" date for this row is \"18 may 2006\".\n\n### Step 2: Find the Screening Completed on 4 October 2006\n\nNow, we need to find a screening completed on \"4 october 2006\". \n\nLooking at the table:\n- The closest dates are \"10 october 2006\" and \"13 october 2006\". \n\nThere is no exact match for \"4 october 2006\". \n\n### Step 3: Assessing the Statement\n\nThe statement mentions a screening completed on \"4 october 2006\", but the table does not have this exact date. The closest dates are 10 and 13 October 2006.\n\nSince the exact date mentioned in the statement is not present in the table, the statement cannot be verified based on the given data.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Five-Month Claim\n\nEven if we consider the closest dates:\n- For \"10 october 2006\", the \"screening started\" is \"11 september 2006\".\n- For \"13 october 2006\", the \"screening started\" is \"7 september 2006\".\n\nThe screening completed on \"30 june 2006\" has a \"screening started\" date of \"18 may 2006\".\n\nNow, the statement claims that the screening completed on 30 June 2006 was started five months after the screening completed on 4 October 2006.\n\nBut since 4 October 2006 isn't in the table, we can't directly verify. However, even if we take the closest:\n\n- From 11 September 2006 to 18 May 2006 is about 4 months (May, June, July, August, September). That's not five months.\n- From 7 September 2006 to 18 May 2006 is similar.\n\nBut the statement says the screening completed on 30 June 2006 was started five months **after** the screening completed on 4 October 2006. \n\nThis would imply:\n- Screening completed on 4 October 2006 \u2192 started on X.\n- Screening completed on 30 June 2006 \u2192 started on X + 5 months.\n\nBut in reality:\n- Screening completed on 30 June 2006 \u2192 started on 18 May 2006.\n- Screening completed on ~10 October 2006 \u2192 started on 11 September 2006.\n\n18 May 2006 is **before** 11 September 2006, not after. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement claims a temporal relationship that is not supported by the table. Specifically:\n1. The exact date \"4 october 2006\" is not present in the table.\n2. Even considering the closest dates, the relationship described (five months after) does not hold.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** by the table.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"

        "predict": "Let's analyze the statement step by step to determine if it is entailed or refuted by the table.\n\n### Statement Breakdown:\n1. **Round 9**: The statement claims that the player was drafted in round 9.\n2. **Player Name**: The player's name is \"Glen Capriola\" (note the spelling: \"Glen\").\n3. **College**: The player's college is \"the Citadel.\"\n\n### Table Verification:\n1. **Round 9**: Looking at the table, row 9 corresponds to round 24 (not round 9). However, the \"pick\" column for row 9 is 24, and the \"overall\" is 247. This seems to be a discrepancy in the table's structure, but the row is labeled as row 9, which might correspond to a later round in the draft. For the sake of this task, we'll assume \"row : 9\" refers to a player drafted in the context of round 24 (as per the \"pick\" column). \n   - The statement says \"round 9,\" but the table shows \"pick 24\" for row 9. This is inconsistent, so the round number is incorrect.\n\n2. **Player Name**: The table lists the name as \"Glenn Capriola\" (with two 'n's), while the statement says \"Glen Capriola\" (one 'n'). This is a mismatch in spelling.\n\n3. **College**: The table lists the college as \"Boston College,\" while the statement says \"the Citadel.\" This is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement is **refuted** by the table because:\n- The round number is incorrect (round 9 vs. pick 24 in row 9).\n- The player's name is misspelled (\"Glen\" vs. \"Glenn\").\n- The college is incorrect (\"the Citadel\" vs. \"Boston College\").\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{refuted}"

The table only provides US viewership data, so it cannot support or confirm the statement about Africa.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe table **refutes** the statement because it does not provide any data about viewership in Africa. The 2.3 million viewers mentioned in the table are explicitly for the US, not Africa.\n\n\\boxed{refuted}"
